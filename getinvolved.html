      content="To support the community science museum, donations both as funds and items for the museums collection are most welcomed. It's also possible to volunteer with time and effort. In return you get access to staff-only lectures, and a free monthly lunch where we discuss ideas for the museum. We also offer internships for everyone, no matter your age."
